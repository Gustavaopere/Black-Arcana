# Modpack Magic Catalog — Phase 2

Status: `IN PROGRESS`

This directory is the canonical Phase 2 inventory for every magic-relevant top-level component in the current Black Arcana modpack.

## Authority order

1. `modlist.txt` snapshot from 2026-09-06 is authoritative for **presence, JAR identity, mod id, runtime name and runtime version**. The snapshot contains 607 top-level entries.
2. Current Notion pages and project guides provide ecosystem classification, gameplay context and known compatibility notes.
3. Official/public documentation, public APIs, changelogs and clean-room observable behavior provide granular spell/glyph/ritual/power facts.
4. External source code may only inform an implementable specification when the exact license permits that use and the provenance ledger requirement has already been satisfied.

Old guide versions never override the current JAR/runtime identity.

## Catalog unit

A provider is not automatically a spell provider. Every relevant component is classified before granular extraction:

- `ENGINE / PRIMARY PROVIDER`
- `SPELL PROVIDER / CONTENT ADDON`
- `ARS GLYPH / SYSTEM PROVIDER`
- `RITUAL / POWER / SUPERNATURAL PROVIDER`
- `GEAR / ENCHANT / SUPPORT CONTENT`
- `BRIDGE / COMPAT / PROGRESSION`
- `LIBRARY / API / VFX / SCRIPTING`

Only components that expose discrete player-facing capabilities require a spell/glyph/ritual/power catalog. Bridges and libraries are still listed because they can change authority, acquisition, UI, animation, resource routing or deduplication.

## Per-capability contract

Where applicable each capability receives:

- real provider + mod id + current JAR/version;
- real registry/content id when publicly verifiable;
- school/domain/category;
- semantic role;
- level/tier/rarity;
- resource and cost;
- cooldown;
- cast/channel time;
- range/area/duration;
- damage/healing/control/summon/world-effect values or formulas;
- acquisition/learning/crafting/loot/progression;
- authority and causal owner;
- relevant VFX/animation/audio;
- compatibility/bridge behavior;
- provenance and confidence.

Unknown data is written as `UNVERIFIED` or `TBD`, never inferred.

## Ars Nouveau rule

Ars Nouveau is compositional. Phase 2 catalogs forms, glyphs, augments, rituals and other finite primitives, then maps the capabilities they can compose. It does **not** enumerate every possible player-authored spell recipe.

## Output

The final Phase 2 product is:

`capability → provider(s) → current coverage → semantic overlap → real gap`

That matrix is the gate for Phase 3. No new Black Arcana spell is approved merely because its presentation differs from an existing provider capability.
